A point is awarded to the player who can get the ball of their color to hit the opponents side. The ball must hit your paddle before you can score points. If the ball is your color than you can not be scored against. The winner is the player who gets 3 or more points and has a score that is at least 2 points greater than the opponent. The winner is rewarded with the sight of a rare \"pepe\" (an internet meme) while the loser is shown the sight of a lesser, common \"pepe\" (also an internet meme). Have fun playing.\r\n\r\nTo start a server run index.js with node and then connect to the IP in your browser with port 7777\r\n\r\nCLASSIFIED","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

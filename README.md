# PROJECT: BAD PIRANHA (aka G-Pong)
Project for HackExeter Spring 2015

Instructions

Your goal is to move your gravity well to direct the ball to hit your paddle to convert the ball to your color and then and hit the other persons side. A point is awarded to the player who can get the ball of their color to hit the opponents side. The ball must hit your paddle before you can score points. If the ball is your color than you can not be scored against. The winner is the player who gets 3 or more points and has a score that is at least 2 points greater than the opponent. The winner is rewarded with the sight of a rare "pepe" (an internet meme) while the loser is shown the sight of a lesser, common "pepe" (also an internet meme). Have fun playing.
